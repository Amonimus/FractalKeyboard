The Fractal Keyboard
by Amonimus
* In theory, can generate every key sequence and make them clickable
* Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OG87X6XSWU
* Purple = pause
* Runs on and requires pygame
* You can change some parameters in the consts.py
* **Do not set dimensions above 6 or your PC will die**, I haven't figured out how to optimize this
* If you can improve this, more power to you
